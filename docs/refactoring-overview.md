# Project Refactoring Overview

## Information

This README document was generated with the assistance of **ChatGPT**, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. The content reflects a structured conversation that addressed the challenges and strategies involved in refactoring our web application. ChatGPT provided guidance and suggestions, which were then adapted and incorporated into this document to effectively communicate the refactoring process to team members and stakeholders.

## Introduction

This document outlines the ongoing refactoring process of transitioning our web application from a traditional, browser-based JavaScript environment to a more structured Node.js and Webpack setup. The goal is to modernize the codebase, improve maintainability, and adopt modular development practices.

## Current Scenario

Our application currently relies on a pattern of dynamically loading JavaScript scripts directly in the browser. The main scripts involved are `main.js` and `loader.js`. The `loader.js` script is responsible for dynamically loading other scripts into the document using a function called `depend`.

## Challenges

- **Non-Modular Code**: Existing scripts are not modular, leading to global function dependencies and potential namespace pollution.
- **Dynamic Script Loading**: The `depend` function dynamically loads scripts, a pattern less common in modern JavaScript development.
- **Transition Complexity**: The project is large, making an immediate, complete overhaul impractical and risky.

## Refactoring Approach

### Gradual Transition

- We are adopting a phased approach to refactor the application, starting with parts of the code that can be easily modularized.
- Initially, we will maintain some legacy patterns to keep the application functional during the transition.

### Handling Global Functions

- Functions that need global access (e.g., `isSkillNameTaken`) will be temporarily attached to the `window` object.
- Example:

  ```javascript
  window.isSkillNameTaken = function() {
    // function body
  };

  ### Maintaining `main.js` and `loader.js`

  ```

- These scripts will continue to serve as entry points, bundled via Webpack.
- Other scripts will still be loaded dynamically using `depend`, outside the Webpack process.

### Future Steps: Embracing Webpack

- Gradually, we will transition to using Webpack's code-splitting feature for optimizing script loading.
- This will involve moving away from global functions and dynamic script loading.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Each step of the refactoring process will be accompanied by thorough testing to ensure continued functionality and performance.

## Conclusion

- Our short-term strategy involves a mix of legacy and modern practices to ensure a smooth transition.
- In the long run, we aim to fully embrace modular development and Webpack's capabilities for a more maintainable and efficient codebase.
