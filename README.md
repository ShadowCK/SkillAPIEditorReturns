# Project Update

The refactoring is essentially finished! Now we are moving forward with a focus on **application performance** and **code cleanliness**. This includes:

- Structure
- Readability/Clarity
- Semantics
- Logic

Next, we will start adding new **Quality of Life (QoL) features** to the editor.

For more information, refer to the documentation below:
